# Banking-System 
In this project, I Developed a python program for developing a simple banking system with a database.

In this project, I found out how the banking system works and how they maintain the user's account details. And used the Luhn algorithm to avoid mistakes when entering the card number by users. I created the database using SQLite available in python modules. I considered basic features like account number, pin, and balance for creating account details. this banking system has features like getting the balance, adding money, transferring from one user account to another.
